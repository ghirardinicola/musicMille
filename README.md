# musicMille

Linux terminal command to create a musicMille spotify mixtape, just as talking with (chat)GPT

## Usage
Create a config.yaml file such as (first entries of spotify):   

    client_id: 
    client_secret: 
    username: 
    open_api_api_key: 

- Create python env using requirement.txt
- python musicMille.py

- Contribuite ;)

## Next
Make it step-by-step:
- Split follow-up questions, they are not that useful now
- Decide it's fine, write to Spotify
- Get a spotify mixtape and start from there (NICE! Start from there, more this, less that)
